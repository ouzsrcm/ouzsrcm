# Merhaba! ðŸ‘‹ _Ciao, Hallo, Bonjour_

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=44DEF7&lines=Software+Developer;Linux+bash+scripting+enthusiast;Frontend+techs+and+JS+dev.)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

My name is OÄŸuz, and I am a passionate, research-oriented, curious and detail-oriented software developer. It has been over 8 years since my passion turned into my profession.

## About me

Throughout my career, I have mainly worked with Microsoft technologies, but I also have many years of experience with Linux. I have been involved in projects related to Server-Side Programming, Single Page Applications, Mobile-First Web Development, and RDBMS Systems. In particular, I have played an active role in the transformation and refactoring of existing web projects.

During these transformations, new technologies and development techniques play a crucial role. For me, passion, curiosity, and continuous learning have always been my strongest companions. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, I believe that keeping up with innovations and applying them effectively is essential to producing the best solutions.

Additionally, I have expertise in Oracle, PLSQL, and TSQL, which I have used effectively for performance optimization and implementing complex business rules.
